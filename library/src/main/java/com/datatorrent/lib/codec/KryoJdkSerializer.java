/**
 * Kryo serializer implementation that can be annotated to operator or tuple
 * classes to have them serialized using JDK serialization instead default Kryo
 * serialization.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is not optimized for speed, JDK serialization is slower
 * than Kryo and should be used as the last resort if you know that the slowness
 * of it is not going to prevent you from operating your application in
 * realtime.
 * <p>
 * Should only be used for classes that cannot be handled by the default Kryo
 * serializer, for example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Third party classes that don't have a default constructor (Kryo requires
 * at least a private no-argument constructor)
 * <li>Non-static inner classes (constructors have implicit outer class
 * reference)
 * <li>Classes with non-transient members that are not supported by Kryo
 * </ul>
 * JDK deserialization won't re-initialize transient members. Port objects on
 * operators that have to be transient when using Kryo have to be non-transient /
 * serializable, when using JDK serialization.
 *
 * This class is deprecated since there is a better implementation via
 * com.esotericsoftware.kryo.serializers.JavaSerializer in the Kryo library.
 *
 * @param <T> type of serialized object
 * @since 0.3.2
 * @deprecated Please use com.esotericsoftware.kryo.serializers.JavaSerializer instead.
