/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of BaseOperator that implements Pig split operator semantic. 
 * <p>
 * A split into node creates multiple streams from a single stream. <br>
 * This operator implements following semantic.  <br>
 * <pre>
 * instream is f1:int, f2:int, f3:int
 *
 * The expression for split into is "X IF f1<7, Y IF f2==5, Z IF (f3<6)"
 *
 * For instream tuples (1,2,3) would produce (1,2,3) on X, (1,2,3) on Z (4,5,6)
 * would produce (4,5,6) on X, (4,5,6) on Y (7,8,9) would produce (7,8,9) on Z
 *
 * This would match to split into metric for Pig
 * </pre>
